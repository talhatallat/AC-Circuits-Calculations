# Calculator for RL parallel circuit 

The computer calculates the voltages, power, current, impedance and reactance for a parallels circuit of a resistor and a inductor.

**Parallel Current**

The supply across the terminals of this circuit is 300 V, 50 Hz.
An ammeter is connected to the supply.

The resistance, R, is 80 Î© and the inductance, L is 350 mH.   

I = !!??

The program helps a user to find a reading on the ammeter.
