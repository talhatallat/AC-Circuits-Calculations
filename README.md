# AC-Circuits-Calculations

<h3>Project description:</h3>

The computer calculates the voltages, power, current, impedance and reactance for a series and parallel circuits of a resistor and a inductor.
Calcolator lets user find unkown values such as total current(I) or voltage in inductor(VL) or resistor value(R) and displayes reactance(XL), Impendance(z), voltage in resistor(VR), voltage in inductor(VL), Phase angle(0), apparent Power(S), real power(P), reactive Power(Q).
