# Calculator for RL series circuit

**Project Description:**

The computer calculates the voltages, power, current, impedance and reactance for a series circuit of a resistor and a inductor.

**Series Current Example**

The supply across the terminals of this circuit is 340 V, 60 Hz.
An ammeter is connected to the supply.
