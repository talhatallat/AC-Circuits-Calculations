# Calculator for RL series circuit

<h3>Project Description:</h3>

The computer calculates the voltages, power, current, impedance and reactance for a series circuit of a resistor and an inductor. 
Calculator lets user find unknown values such as total current(I) or voltage in inductor(VL) or resistor value(R) and displays reactance(XL), Impendence(z), voltage in resistor(VR), voltage in inductor(VL), Phase angle(0), apparent Power(S), real power(P), reactive Power(Q).

<h2>Finding Series Current Example</h2>

The supply across the terminals of this circuit is 340 V, 60 Hz.
An ammeter is connected to the supply.
