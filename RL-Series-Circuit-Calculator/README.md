# Calculator for RL series circuit

**Project Description:**

The computer calculates the voltages, power, current, impedance and reactance for a series circuit of a resistor and a inductor.

<h2>Finding Series Current Example</h2>

The supply across the terminals of this circuit is 340 V, 60 Hz.
An ammeter is connected to the supply.

The resistance, R, is 40 Ω and the inductance, L is 200 mH.

I = ____ !?

The program will help a user to find the reading on the ammeter:   


<h2>Finding Series Inductance Example</h2>

The supply across the terminals of this circuit is 400 V, 60 Hz.
An ammeter is connected to the supply.

The resistance, R, is 40 Ω.
The ammeter reading the supply current shows 6 A.    
Find the inductance, L, in mH:
L  =  
141.47
Your answer is correct
  mH
